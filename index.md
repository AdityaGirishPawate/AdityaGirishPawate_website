## About
I am Aditya Girish Pawate, currently, a third-year undergraduate student from the Department of Mathematics enrolled in its integrated Master's course in Mathematics and Computing at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.
Over the last year, I have grown fascinated by the field of Machine Learning Processing and am very passionate about contributing to it. Ever since I have gotten to know about this field I have been reading and learning and trying to apply something interesting in this field.
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/AdityaGirishPawate/AdityaGirishPawate.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Work Experience
### Research Intern at Autonomous Systems and Robotics
Worked under Natalia Diaz Rodriguez, Autonomous Systems and Robotics , Professor at ENSTA ParisTech, France in collaboration with CERN scientists Simone Gennai, Pietro Govoni and Fabio Stella from University of Milan-Bicocca, Italy. Created a classification model for the trigger path of HH->bbbb event in Large Hadron Collider for upcoming CMS Run3 in 2021. Created many models including Bayesian Networks, XGBoost, Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN Classifier, Gradient Boosting Machines, Generalized Linear Models, DNN, CNN, LSTM, GRU and Variational Autoencoders using Bayesian Neural Networks. Created explanation frameworks in order to build trust in our model using LIME, SHAP, GRAD-CAM, DeepLIFT, DeepRED, CausalNex. I also checked for robustness of our model by Gaussian Smearing, Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and Environment Simulation Test. I achieved a 50% Signal Acceptance for less than 0.2% background acceptance while the 2018 benchmark for CMS run 2 had a 22.6% Signal Acceptance with similar background acceptance. The model was reasonably robust against changes to the variables.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/AdityaGirishPawate/AdityaGirishPawate.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
